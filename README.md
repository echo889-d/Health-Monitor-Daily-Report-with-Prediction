# Health-Monitor-Daily-Report-with-Prediction
The project aims to utilize linear regression ​modeling, incorporating key metrics such as ​net, spend and in-app purchases (IAP) on day ​1, to predict future data points as they mature. ​The primary goal is to generate daily reports ​with predictive insights, providing ​stakeholders with an expectation of the app's ​health over time.
